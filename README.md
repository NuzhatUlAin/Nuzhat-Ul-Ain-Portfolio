# CrimeSight App

This project was an exciting journey to work on! The CrimeSight App is designed to enhance safety and security by providing a comprehensive set of features tailored for both users and guardians. Initially, the goal was to create a simple emergency alert app, but it evolved into a robust platform with functionalities like emergency contact management, remote feed viewing, real-time notifications, and user profile management. The app integrates Firebase and Azure for backend services, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience. What I enjoyed most about developing this app was implementing features like real-time alerts and remote feed integration, which required balancing Flutter's widgets and state management solutions to create a smooth and intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Emergency Contacts Management**: Add, view, and manage personal and general emergency contacts.
- **Remote Feed Viewing**: Access remote camera feeds with support for YouTube streams.
- **Alert Notifications**: Receive real-time alerts and notifications for emergencies.
- **User Profile Management**: Manage user profiles, including night mode.
- **Login & Signup**: Secure login and signup using Firebase and shared preferences.
- **Clips Management**: Retrieve and manage video clips.
- **Night Mode Toggle**: Using night mode for added safety.
